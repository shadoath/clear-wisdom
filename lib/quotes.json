I've been leading and building sales orgs for almost 20 years and my advice is to walk up and hit the ball.\n\n2. Sales is about people and it's about problem solving. It is not about solutions or technology or chemicals or lines of code or artichokes. It's about people and it's about solving problems.\n\n3. People buy 4 things and 4 things only. Ever. Those 4 things are time, money, sex, and approval/peace of mind. If you try selling something other than those 4 things you will fail.\n\n4. People buy aspirin always. They buy vitamins only occasionally and at unpredictable times. Sell aspirin.\n\n5. I say in every talk I give: 'All things being equal, people buy from their friends. So make everything else equal, then go make a lot of friends.'\n\n6. Being valuable and useful is all you ever need to do to sell things. Help people out. Send interesting posts. Write birthday cards. Record videos sharing your ideas for growing their business. Introduce people who would benefit from knowing each other, then get out of the way, expecting nothing in return. Do this consistently and authentically and people will find ways to give you money. I promise.\n\n7. No one cares about your quota, your payroll, your opex, your burn rate, etc. No one.

You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something.

    "quote": "**Interviewer:** \"Did you know as a child you wanted to be a writer?\"\n\n**Toni Morrison:** \"No. I wanted to be a reader. I thought everything that needed to be written had already been written or would be. I only wrote the first book because I thought it wasn't there, and I wanted to read it when I got through. I am a pretty good reader. I love it. It is what I do, really. So, if I can read it, that is the highest compliment I can think of. People say, I write for myself, and it sounds so awful and so narcissistic, but in a sense if you know how to read your own work— that is, with the necessary critical distance—it makes you a better writer and editor. When I teach creative writing, I always speak about how you have to learn how to read your work; I don't mean enjoy it because you wrote it. I mean, go away from it, and read it as though it is the first time you've ever seen it. Critique it that way. Don't get all involved in your thrilling sentences and all that…\"\n\nLater in the same interview, she adds:\n\n\"After all, this is my work. I have to take full responsibility for doing it right as well as doing it wrong. Doing it wrong isn't bad, but doing it wrong and thinking you've done it right is.\"",

But we have to, all of us, and we have to do it every day, over and over and polish every rough edge off until this product is as smooth as lacquered mahogany.\n\nEach of you knows 'really good.' Each of you is able to see when things are not done well. Certainly, we all complain enough about other people's software, and we all know how important first impressions are in our own judgments. That is exactly how others will evaluate us.\n\nPutting yourself in the mind of someone who is coming to Slack for the first time — especially a real someone, who is being made to try this thing by their boss, who is already a bit hangry because they didn't have time for breakfast, and who is anxious about finishing off a project before they take off for the long weekend — putting yourself in their mind means looking at Slack the way you look at some random piece of software in which you have no investment and no special interest. Look at it hard, and find the things that do not work.\n\nBe harsh, in the interest of being excellent.\"",
